# vgpavilion

This is my new management tool for my videogame preservation site [Videogame Pavilion](https://vgpavilion.com) but I am making this public for anyone else thinking of creating a similar site. This tool will create and manage a database of Magazines, Advertising, Platforms and Games plus related entities. It will then publish all the information as a static site that can be hosted anywhere.
